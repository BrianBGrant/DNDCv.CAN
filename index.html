   <p> My name is Brian Grant. I am an ecosystem model developer and application specialist for the DNDCv.CAN model at Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada. I work collaborate on
       the development of this model with Dr. Ward Smith (team lead). We also work with Dr. William Salas @ Regrow. The Canada version of DNDC is suitable for most agricultural regions
       however it is focused to work in cold-temperate climates like Canada.</p>
